- Learnt how to use the box function that stacks items on top of each other.
- I used column and Row functions interchangeably.
- Leveraged WHEN expression over IF-ELSE.
- Learnt how to declare functions and use functions declared in another function.
- I further understood the use of the lambda functions. This was essential in the making the onclick function better.
